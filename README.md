# Restaurant Bansai Single-Form-Application






This project was created in the framework of PHP JAM on the BlackScorp Discord Server.

Here you can see a reservation form where you have to fill in all fields except 
for notes in order to send a reservation. If you leave a real email, you will also 
get a confirmation email. There you will find all the important data for your visit 
and a link with which you can cancel your reservation. All your data will be deleted 
from the DB, and you can rest assured. Parts of the code were programmed OOP and some
functions were also oriented. 
I also switched off the error reporting so that it doesn't get smacked in the face of 
the visitors ...

I hope you like my project:)
